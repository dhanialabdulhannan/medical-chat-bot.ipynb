Medical Chatbot – Project Description

The Medical Chatbot is an intelligent conversational system designed to assist users with basic health-related queries. It can interact with users in a simple and user-friendly manner and provide initial guidance for common health issues.

This chatbot is capable of:

Understanding user symptoms and health concerns

Providing general medical information and home-based remedies

Offering guidance related to Ayurvedic, Naturopathy, and Homeopathic practices

Giving preventive health tips and wellness suggestions

Assisting users in identifying when professional medical consultation is required

The system uses Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user input and generate relevant responses. It is designed to improve health awareness, reduce unnecessary hospital visits, and provide quick, reliable assistance for non-emergency health issues.

This chatbot does not replace a doctor, but acts as a supportive healthcare assistant to guide users toward better health decisions.
